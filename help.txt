```Rolls are looking the same as they presented in a corebook:

!roll *number_of_dices* *roll_threshold*

As bot supports default  **roll_threshold** as 6, you can skip this part and type

!roll *number_of_dices*

Add -e in the end of comand to roll with explosive option (every 10 on roll will be reroled extra time)

If you need some extra of d10 dices, type

!roll *number_of_dices*d*dice_type* *roll_threshold*

Or skip **roll_threshold**, and it will counted as 6

!roll *number_of_dices*d*dice_type*

Wish you nice time <3```
