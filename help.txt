```Rolls are looking the same as they presented in a corebook:

!r *number_of_dices* *roll_threshold*
!r 3 6

As bot supports default  **roll_threshold** as 6, you can skip this part and type
!r *number_of_dices*
!r 4

Add -e in the end of comand to roll with explosive option (every 10 on roll will be reroled extra time)
!r *your throw info* -e
!r 4 -e

If you need some extra of d10 dices, use
!r *number_of_dices*d*dice_type* *roll_threshold*
!r 4d20 10

It's also works with default threshold as 6

To roll initiative type
!i *Dexterity* *Wits*
!i 3 4

Or you can type it only once, is they are equal
!i *Dexterity or Wits*
!i 3

Wish you nice time <3```
